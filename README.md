### Hi 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in the UK.

Professionally, I work with C++ and C#. Personally, I tinker with React, Electron and all of the fun stuff in between!

## Things I've done 🚀
I would list my projects out here, but I spent a good night on making a fancy little way to navigate them over on my website so I'll simply plug that page instead!

## Things I'm doing 🧐
Learning! Gathering as much experience anyhow and anywhere that I can. I am constantly making small and large personal projects to further what I know.
